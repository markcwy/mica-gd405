## Main assignment
We continue to design the letterforms and move into the parametric type design. 

1. Look back at your previous letter design assignment.
1. Choose one design (or a combination) that you want to develop further.
1. Design a few more letters first - all the vowels - `a`, `e`, `i`, `o` and `u` + consonants - `h`, `m`, `b`, `g` and `s`. It is suggested that you use Illustrator or graph paper to plot each letter before going into coding.
1. Now, think about what typographic properties you can control by turning them into variables/parameters. Examples include letter width, letter height, x-height, serif, weight, slant, spacing, tracking, color, contrast, roundness, etc.
1. Convert each letter drawing code into a function and parameters.
1. You must be able to set the type at any location by adding `x` and `y` parameters. Plus, add two optional parameters of your choice.
1. *(This step is optional.)* Organize your code so that `mouseX` and `mouseY` can control each of the two parameters you added in the last step.
1. In your p5 sketch, write a few different words you can create out of the letters you designed. You might use a website like [this](http://www.litscape.com/word_tools/contains_only.php).

### Deliverables
- 5 to 7 screenshots of some design variations on Google Drive Week 3 folder.
- The Codepen link of your sketch on Google Drive.
- Use comments - `//` and `/* */` to describe what each block does in your program.
