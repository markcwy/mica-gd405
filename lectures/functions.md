# Functions
A function is a building block of a software. `createCanvas()`, `line()`, `stroke()` -- These are the functions that p5 give us so we provide them with parameters and use. By combining multiple functions, we can build something more complex. We can also create our own functions.

- modularize your program

- break it into smaller sections. easier to manage, change and read.

- resusable by calling it multiple times
