# Week 1 assignments

## Journal
You will create and keep the process journal for the entire semester. The purpose of this journal is to track your own progress, have a closer look at your own process, reflect upon your own work so that we have a better understanding of ourselves and find a way to improve. 

You will update it regularly, at least once a week or more, throughout the semester. Find a way to organize your thoughts. (formats, posting frequency, time and days) 

1. Create an account on [Trello](http://trello.com) and make it public so your instructor and classmates can access.
2. Document the course-related materials with with text, image, videos, and/or links. 
3. Things you will include: 
  - inspirations you find,
  - research materials
  - sketches, 
  - screenshots of your workspace,
  - photos,
  - notes you create, 
  - prototypes, 
  - code snippets,
  - links to your code, 
  - summary of each class meeting,
  - questions you have,
  - discussions you have with classmates
4. Keep it professional. Only work-related postings.

For this week, reflect on the things discussed in class, and think about how this class can be related to your own interest, how it can be integrated into or expand what you've already been doing, or what new things you will want to explore. Write them down on your journal.

Secondly, look up online, books, videos, etc. on the topic of computational typography and find at least two interesting articles and/or examples. The, research more into their creators/authors, processes, technologies and/or contents. Log them on your journal along with your thoughts and impressions.

Feel free to add more contents to your journal throughout the week. Although your journal is publicly available, it is your own space.
