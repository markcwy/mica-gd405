## Watch video tutorials

We will use Dan Shiffman's Coding Train as course supplement. Watch the video tutorials below and try running some example codes in Processing. You may fast-forward, speed up or rewatch as necessary. Take notes and post screenshots of your digital or written notes (as a proof of your study) on Google drive. If some of the contents do not make sense, bring back questions next class. **If the assignment is not ready in Google Drive by the beginning of next class, that's a late assignment.**
