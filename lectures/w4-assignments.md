  - 4.1 ~ 4.2: loops
  - 6.1 ~ 6.2: arrays
  
Visit [the Kadenze Course](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/introduction-to-programming-for-the-visual-arts-with-p5-js-i) and watch the videos:
  - Session 5: Synthesis A, Nonlinear Narrative

It is important that you take notes and questions on your journal while watching the videos.

## Reading
Read [this tutorial](http://genekogan.com/code/p5js-transformations/) on transformation, and try to understand as much as you can.

## Type Design
We will continue with your type design.

### Part 1
1. Refine your design and codes.
1. Keep working with the parameters. Be flexible so that it can respond to different situations.
1. Design six additional letters. (by next week, you should have at least 16 letters.)
1. Apply conditional statements and keyboard interactions in your code so that the letters can be typed.
1. Animation is not required in this assignment.
1. Post the Codepen link on Google Drive Week 4.

### Part 2
For part 2, you may or may not use the same program from the part 1 as the interaction is not required. You could instead create a separate program and it may give you more flexibility. After all, what we are creating is *a system*, so there can be many different applications.

- 10 different static compositions showcasing the capability/flexibility of your computational type system. Show different parametric combinations - a range of expressions. Use phrases or sentences of your choice. Keep the background white.
- Another image that contains all the letters you have designed so far. Keep the background white.
- Try to export high-resolution images.
- Upload all the images on Google Drive Week 4 folder.
- Codepen link should be posted on Google Drive.

*Feel free to use Processing to export high quality images.*
